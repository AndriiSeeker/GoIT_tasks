### I'm you Personal Assistant bot. _I was created by a group of Python enthusiasts to make your life easier_.

---

## What I can to do:

You as a user have the option to use **Address Book**, **Notebook** or a **File Sorter**.

Once the bot is inatalled you call it by typing **console-bot** in the terminal.

$\color{blue}{Address Book}$ you can operate the following features:

- add contacts with the name and a phone number
- change contact's phone number
- add birthday, email address and address to the contacts
- count the number of days that are left to the contact's birthday
- display a singular contact details or all contacts
- look up the specific contacts by a part of the number or name

$\color{purple}{Notebook}$ the following operations are available:

- add notes with text and tags
- search notes by tags
- adjust/update/correct notes

$\color{green}{File Sorter}$ will sort your files into the folders according to their extensions. In order to start the File sorter - please provide the path to the folder you wish to sort.

## How can you install me:

```
pip install -e Apllepy-personal-assistant==0.1.5
